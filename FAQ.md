# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: Is this list only for those groups run by MVPs?
A: Absolutely not, this is for all Microsoft-related user groups regardless of whether MVPs are involved or not.

## Q: Why is this being done on GitHub? Not every user group us about code or even tech?
A: Good question! While it would be nice to run this off a pretty website, GitHub offers one of the best and easiest ways for the community to actually contribute directly to the listing. If we think of another way that's just as easy but prettier, we'll do it!

A: [Loryan Strant](https://www.loryanstrant.com) is a Microsoft MVP who specialises in Office 365. While this is "his" GitHub account, anyone is able to contribute to the site and listing.
